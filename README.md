# Embers Of Armageddon
A mod for GZDoom that attempts to recreate the weapons, items, combat mechanics, and upgrade systems of DOOM (2016) in the classic Doom games.

This repository only contains the code behind the mod.  You will also need to acquire the **EOA Assets** file in order to be able to play the mod properly, as that has all the necessary graphics and sounds.  [You can download that from here](https://www.guilded.gg/EOA/groups/36M0PXOz/channels/0411c69d-01ac-468a-bd80-fd980c642856/docs), along with the latest (stable) EOA release.
