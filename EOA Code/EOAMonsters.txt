Ooh, now we have damage values for the monsters to scale!  Taken from "http://www.burningconcept.com/DOOM/doom-bestiary.html".

We'll compare the value as seen on the site to 8/5 of the vanilla monster's health value (which is the value to be used in Doom, if it has a counterpart... others will have estimations).
