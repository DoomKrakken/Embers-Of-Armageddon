- Upgrade items can now appear in place of every 24th ammo box.
- Delta V Thrust Boots now spawn in place of the usual items occasionally.  Once picked up, it will give the item to ALL players present and cease to spawn thereafter.  If a player joins the game, and the boots had been picked up, then the newly-joined player will receive boots as well.
- Added a CVar that allows players to start the game with a pair of Delta V Thrust Boots.
- Frag Grenade deals 8 damage from direct impact.

- If the player has Berserk and purchases a mod from a Field Drone, then the mod will automatically be installed on the weapon (previously, if you switched to the weapon after Berserk expired, it would then go to the mod-equipping animation, which it should do when you auto-switch to the weapon from selecting a mod, which is impossible when you have Berserk because the Berserk Fists weapon disallows weapon switching until Berserk has expired).
- Updated entries for Pinkies/Spectres in EOAMonsters.txt.
- A_SpawnPersistentNoiseMaker now automatically updates its sound volume using A_SoundVolume.

- BFG Cells can now replace every 4th cell pickup that replaces small cell ammo pickups.  However, there cannot be 2 or more other static cell ammo pickups or a Plasma Rifle or a Gauss Cannon within 256 units of clear sight from said cell pickup.  This behavior is overridden if there also happens to be a BFG within 256 units of clear sight from said cell pickup.
- Cell ammo that replaces large cell ammo pickups are now replaced with BFG cells if there aren't 2 or more other static cell ammo pickups or a Plasma Rifle or a Gauss Cannon within 256 units of clear sight from said cell pickup.

This way, the Event Handler won't interfere with item placement in any custom maps utilizing EOA's items directly.
- Removed the ISMONSTER flag from EOA_HologramProjection.
- Removed most exception checking for EOA_HologramProjection.
- Actors inheriting from "EOA_Health", "EOA_Armor", or "EOA_Ammo" now execute their pickup specials upon being touched (previously had to be successfully picked up in order to do so).  As these items cannot be picked up when the player is at full capacity of said items, and several such items replace actors that can always be picked up, this will fix any progression issues that may arise from this without the player having to sacrifice resources or cheat in order to continue.

- Removed the call to Console.PrintF that would show the amount of Saving Throws the player had before getting one taken away.  This should've been done before the initial Alpha Release.
