Credits!

Resources and code came from all sorts of places.  Plenty of credits are assigned in the many different places where the credited source is used.

In general, I want to thank everyone who has contributed to this project, one way or another... be it helping with code, making sprites, providing suggestions and support, etc.

If I forget anyone, or you feel that credits given here are improperly done, do not hesitate to tell me about it (with all due respect, please).  I want to make sure I give credit where it's due, and I expect that this file will undergo all sorts of changes as time passes.

Without further ado... let's roll the credits! :D
