******** Stuff to do (in no particular order) ********
= Heavy Assault Rifle
	- Convert ZION's Tactical Scope HUD graphics to ZScript for maximum efficiency.
= Gauss Cannon
	- Fix the Siege Trails to turn more inward on each other to look more like they're spiraling.
= Item brightmaps.
= Write Moar Credits.
= Get additional resources from other contributors.
	- It'd be lovely to have a centered Mobile Turret transformation sequence animation, like the one in DOOM.
= Integrate Rune Trial maps into the core mod.
= Impact Compensation.
= "Low Ammo" indicator.
= Implement TT-Supermolot font for better HUD recreation accuracy.
= Implement additional CVar options for manipulating aesthetics/gameplay:
	- Toaster Mode.
= Use better friction systems (check with ZMovement).
= Change sector light levels, damage amounts, and damage intervals on the fly.
= Implement screen timers for powerups.
= Implement improved Siphon Grenade effects (in-world and on HUD).
= Implement dynamic challenge systems for people to write their own challenges or to utilize their own challenge lists.
= Heretic/Hexen/Strife compatibility.
= Desaturated translations.
= Better bullet-time.
= Plenty of other stuff that I've forgotten to write down. XD
