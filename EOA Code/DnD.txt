Damage 'n Distance!

What, you were expecting Dungeons 'n Dragons?!

Well, too bad!  It was me, DIO!  And the Spanish Inquisition!

Enough dungposting.

The following information is based off of damage/distance values found in DOOM (2016) as were found on "http://gameswiki.net/doom-all-weapons-details/".  It appears to be the only source where these numbers were posted.  Keep in mind, the values are done in 100s and 1000s, instead of 10s and 100s we typically see in Doom.  They will be listed here as a reference: not as straight numbers, but as comparison with each other for percentages/ratios between each other, so that they can eventually be scaled down to work within Doom, when compared to Doom's original damage/distance values.

The Chaingun's values here seem very inaccurate.  Over 2.5 years of observation, I can definitively say that the Chaingun's slugs deal more damage than the Heavy Assault Rifle's bullets.

After much pondering, it seems that most (if not all) values here, pertaining to damage and distance, can be reduced to 40% of their original value, especially when compared to "vanilla" values.
